    <description>## weasel-pageant

`weasel-pageant` allows you to use SSH keys held by [PuTTY's](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)
Pageant "daemon" (or compatible, such as the version of Pageant included in 
[PuTTY-CAC](https://github.com/NoMoreFood/putty-cac) or the SSH agent mode in
[Gpg4win](https://www.gpg4win.org/)) from inside the
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about).

The source (and this documentation) is heavily based on
[`ssh-pageant`](https://github.com/cuviper/ssh-pageant) 1.4 by Josh Stone, which allows
interacting with Pageant from Cygwin/MSYS programs.

`weasel-pageant` works like `ssh-agent`, except that it leaves the key storage to
PuTTY's Pageant.  It sets up an authentication socket and prints the environment
variables, which allows the OpenSSH client to use it. It works by executing from the
WSL side a Win32 helper program which interfaces with Pageant and communicating with
it through pipes.

It is probably the most useful if your SSH keys can't be copied to the WSL environment,
such as when using a smart card for SSH authentication. Testing is mainly performed
with Pageant-CAC, though Gpg4win has been seen to work in the past. Note that when
using Gpg4win, only the SSH agent part will be forwarded. There is no support for
forwarding the GPG agent socket.

**SECURITY NOTICE:** All the usual security caveats applicable to WSL apply.
Most importantly, all interaction with the Win32 world happens with the credentials of
the user who started the WSL environment. In practice, *if you allow someone else to
log in to your WSL environment remotely, they may be able to access the SSH keys stored in
your Pageant with `weasel-pageant`.* This is a fundamental feature of WSL; if you
are not sure of what you're doing, do not allow remote access to your WSL environment
(e.g. by starting an SSH server).

`weasel-pageant` does not work on a version of Windows 10 older
than 1703 ("Creators Update"), because it requires the
[Windows/Ubuntu interoperability support](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/2016/10/19/windows-and-ubuntu-interoperability/)
feature shipped with that version. It has been verified to work with versions
up to and including 1809 ("October 2018 Update").</description>
